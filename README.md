# ASP.NET Tiny Security

ASP.NET Tiny Security Providers is a free, open source, pack of tiny ASP.NET Membership, Role and Profile providers.
The goal of this project is to provide custom implementation of ASP.NET providers against tiny data storages (XML, SQL Compact etc.).

**Features**
* Native support and usage by all ASP.NET membership controls;
* Supports all password formats: Clear, Encrypted and Hashed;

Please haave in mind, because of the tiny data storages, it is not recommended to use this providers with "heavy-duty" membership sites (a lot of roles, users and big number of members).  
Tiny Security Providers best fit for sites with small number of authenticated users and hosted on servers with no database access.

For further details check out the Documentation.
